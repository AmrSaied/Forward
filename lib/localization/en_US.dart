  "NMEC_explore": "NMEC is the first museum in the Arab world focusing on the earliest civilization in history - the ancient Egyptian civilization. It is the only museum in Egypt that offers the visitor a general overview of all the different historical periods that encompass Egypt. This has been approached as a layered cumulative product regarding the interaction of the Egyptian people with their land throughout history. This has been created via a multidisciplinary thematic approach designed to highlight Egyptâ€™s tangible and intangible heritage. In addition, NMEC is an important cultural, educational, recreational, and research center for local and international visitors and scholars",
